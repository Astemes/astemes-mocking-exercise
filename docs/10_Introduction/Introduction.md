# Mocking Exercise

This exercise introduces the concept of using mocks to test code. 
You will complete it using test driven development l, so you will be writing a test, make it pass and refactor.
This cycle is repeated until the exercise is done. 

To start, the instructions will be rather detailed, and as the exercise progresses you will be given less instructions about the basics of the tools used.

The exercise is designed to be close to something you could actually run into.
It is not a toy example and we will write code which could actually be used. 
Because of this, you will get more information than needed in the exercise and you will have to ignore information irrelevant to the task.
